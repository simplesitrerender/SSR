npm run dev

## File standarts

- To create a website route create a new folder in the routes folder
- To create a new page create a new file in the folder with the name page.ssr
- To create a new script create a new file in the folder with the name page.ts

- Scripts are always in typescript
- Page files are made in html so you can use all the html tags
- Because the main tags are already defined in the code you dont need to add extra tags (You can instantly use tags like h1, h2, p, etc)
